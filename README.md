# Algorithm Challenge – Level 3 | #10 Sum of Matrix Elements

🧮 Problem Description
-
This challenge demonstrates how to calculate the sum of all elements inside a 3×3 matrix filled with random numbers.

The program prints the matrix first, then aggregates all values into a single sum.

💡 What You’ll Learn
-
- Traversing two-dimensional arrays
- Aggregating data from matrices
- Understanding full matrix traversal
- Writing reusable and readable C++ functions
- Applying algorithmic thinking to simple problems

---

🧩 Core Algorithm Concept
-
The algorithm iterates through every cell in the matrix and adds its value to a running total.

This is a foundational aggregation technique used widely in data processing and engineering systems.
